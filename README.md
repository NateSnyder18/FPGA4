# FPGA4

For this lab I initialized an input 5-bit number, and an output 5-bit variable. Each bit of output maps to a specific LED. I used a case statement to control the value of the the output based on the input. If it is a multiple of 2, LED1 will turn on; if it is a multiple of 3, LED2 will turn on; if it is a multiple of 4, LED3 will turn on; and if it is a multiple of 5, LED4 will turn on. If the number meets the conditions for 2, 3, and 5, LED5 will turn on. LED1-LED5 map to the output LED left to right 1-5.
